# victorops\_escalation\_policy

[Team Escalation Policies](https://portal.victorops.com/public/api-docs.html#/Escalation32Policies) set who is actually on-call for a given team and are the link to utilize any rotations that have been created.

Note:

    - You need to fetch an existing Rotation Group Slug through the VO public API - [GET-Rotations](https://portal.victorops.com/public/api-docs.html#!/Rotations/get_api_public_v1_teams_team_rotations) for creating an escalation policy resource from Terraform
    - Update/Delete operations on an escalation policy may fail if it involves deleting or updating a routing key (not supported in current state of the Terraform provider)

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "victorops_escalation_policy" "vikings_high_severity" {
  name    = "High Severity"
  team_id = victorops_team.team_vikings.id
  step {
    timeout = 0
    entries = [
      {
        type = "rotationGroup"
        slug = "rtg-wvvhXshpvaRdn7jM"
      }
    ]
  }
  step {
    timeout = 10
    entries = [
      {
        type = "rotationGroup"
        slug = "rtg-hfy3fUytq7otMNbf"
      }
    ]
  }
}

resource "victorops_escalation_policy" "vikings_low_severity" {
  name    = "Low Severity"
  team_id = victorops_team.team_vikings.id
  step {
    timeout = 0
    entries = [
      {
        type = "rotationGroup"
        slug = "rtg-wvvhXshpvaRdn7jM"
      }
    ]
  }
  step {
    timeout = 300
    entries = [
      {
        type = "rotationGroup"
        slug = "rtg-hfy3fUytq7otMNbf"
      }
    ]
  }
  step {
    timeout = 300
    entries = [
      {
        type = "targetPolicy"
        slug = victorops_escalation_policy.vikings_high_severity.id
      }
    ]
  }
}
